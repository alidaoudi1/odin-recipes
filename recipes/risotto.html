<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make with rice. Originating in Italy, risotto is a
    recipe made by simmering a starchy variety of rice in broth, with flavor-boosting ingredients added like onions,
    garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese. This 5-star recipe for mushroom risotto has thousands of
    ratings and reviews, and is a top-rated favorite for our Allrecipes community of home cooks.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken broth
        Homemade chicken broth is always the best choice for flavor, but you can use store-bought chicken broth for
        convenience. Choose low-sodium broth and adjust the seasonings at the end. Since you'll keep it hot on the stove
        while you're stirring it into the risotto, you can bump up the flavor of the broth by simmering it with scraps
        of shallots, chives, and mushroom stems left over from prepping the risotto ingredients. To make this
        vegetarian, substitute vegetable broth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Olive oil
        For sautéing the mushrooms and shallots. You won't be cooking at high heat, so it's okay to use extra virgin
        olive oil.
    </li>
    Mushrooms
    This recipe uses a combination of portobello and white mushrooms. See how to clean mushrooms.
    </li>

    <li>
        Shallots
        If you don't have shallots, you can substitute finely chopped yellow onion.
    </li>

    <li>

        Arborio rice
        To get that signature creamy risotto texture, you must use a particular type of short-grain, high-starch rice
        like Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano that releases its starch as you cook and stir. No other rice will give
        you the same results.
    </li>

    <li>

        White wine
        The first liquid you add to the pan after you sauté the rice is a half cup of wine — it will absorb into every
        grain and create an essential layer of flavor. Choose wisely. Go for a crisp, dry white wine like pinot grigio
        or sauvignon blanc. If you don't want to use wine, just start with the broth.
    </li>

    <li>

        Butter
        A generous amount of butter at the end adds more creamy texture and rich flavor.
    </li>

    <li>

        Parmesan cheese
        You've come this far. Don't shortchange the flavor of your risotto by using anything other than freshly grated
        Parmesan cheese.
    </li>

    <li>

        Chives
        Chives cut through the richness and add visual appeal, too. If you don't have chives, fresh parsley is a good
        substitute.</li>

    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Hot broth
        Keep the broth hot the whole way through. Measure out a little more into the broth pot than the recipe says to
        make up for evaporation as it sits.
    </li>
    <li> Toast the rice
        An essential step to making risotto is to toast the grains in hot oil until they start to turn translucent
        around the edges. This could take a couple of minutes. Stir continuously during this process.
    </li>

    <li> Stir
        Yes, you stir risotto as it simmers. That's what helps release the starch from the grains of rice to make that
        creamy texture you want. Do you have to stir constantly? No. Stir after each half cup of broth you add to make
        sure the broth is distributed evenly, then stir again every 30 seconds or so until almost all the broth is
        absorbed. Add another half cup of broth and repeat. Listen to music. Sip some wine. Good risotto is worth the
        time it takes.
    </li>

    <li> Temperature
        Keep the broth hot and the risotto at a low simmer throughout.
    </li>

    <li> Texture
        Risotto is done when the rice is al dente: firm but not crunchy when you bite into it. It should not be as dry
        as steamed rice, but should have enough liquid to make it loose. Add just a touch more broth if needed before
        stirring in the butter and Parmesan cheese.
    </li>

    <li> Serve immediately
        Risotto waits for no one. It will continue to cook as it sits even when it's off the heat, so be prepared to
        dish it up right away.
    </li>
